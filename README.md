In order to view the project:

MUST have npm installed

1. Clone repo
2. run "pip install r- requirements.txt" inside backend/app directory (if that isn't the exact command, it's pretty close.)
3. run "npm install" to install frontend packages
4. run "npm run dev" within frontend directory to launch the frontend on port 5173.
5. run "uvicorn main:app --reload" in another terminal, within backend/app directory.

That's it!
